# PostfixCalculator

## Introduction 
The purpose of this lab is to design a program to implement a calculator, but there is a difference this time around: the calculator will first perform an infix to postfix conversion and then evaluate the resulting postfix expression.
You should implement the calculator in two parts: 
1.	A Converter class that will convert the input string to postfix expression. 
2.	A Calculator class that will evaluate the postfix expression

You are not allowed to use any built-in classes in the Java library(such as ArrayList or something else), but use the ArrayStack and LinkedStack provided. 


## Implementation and Design

## The Calculator class

•	The Calculator class will instantiate an object of the Converter class in order to have the infix expression converted to a postfix expression.

•	Parentheses are legal in the infix expression (Note: the parentheses are needed in the infix expression. After your Converter class' algorithm converts the expression to postfix, it will no longer have parentheses because they are not necessary in postfix expressions.)

In postfix notation,  the operator is written after the two operands. An expression with multiple operators is evaluated in the same way, from left to right which each operator applied to the two previous operands.

 
## The Converter class

The purpose of the Converter class is to take an infix expression that is generated by the user, and convert it to a postfix expression that can be evaluated using code. The Converter class uses a stack to accomplish this. Here is how it works:

•	When the Converter class is instantiated,  a String is passed representing the infix expression entered by the user.  This should be saved as an instance variable.

•	The method that does all the work in the Converter class should be called toPostFix(). It will convert the infix expression to a postfix expression. The postfix expression should be a string that can be evaluated by the calculator. Each operator and operand should be separated by spaces. This is not necessarily true of the input (i.e., the original infix expression might look like “2+2” instead of “2 + 2”).

•	The first thing the converter class does is to tokenize the input string into a list of tokens representing operators and operands. Parenthesis are also allowed in infix expressions, so "(" and ")" are valid tokens. A parser method has been provided to you for your convenience - see the ParserHelper.java file

•	Once the input is tokenized, a stack is used to convert to a postfix expression. 


## How to Play?
The input will always be some mathematical expression that contains a combination of the operations +,-,*,/, and ^. All of the numbers will be integers. You may assume that the expressions will never miss an operand (e.g., you won’t encounter something like “3 + ”). Here are some example inputs to try out
•	3+4*5/6
•	(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7)
•	(4+8)*(6-5)/((3-2)*(2+2))
